# EDA-Insomnia-in-Adolescence

## Introduction

This project uses data collected as part of a larger study funded by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute investigating the pathophysiology of insomnia in adolescence.

* <b>Dataset</b>: <a href="[https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Insomnia_in_adolescence/19214676?file=34138404)">Insomnia in Adolescence</a> [20Mb]

* <b>Description</b>: Data are based on self-report rating of demographic data and standardized questionnaires assessing insomnia-relevant factors in adolescents, including sleep quality and habits, sleep-related cognition, stress, and stress reactivity, coping and emotion regulation behavior, mood, personality, and childhood trauma.


The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken

<li><b>Date</b>: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy </li>
<li><b>Time</b>: time in format hh:mm:ss </li>
<li><b>Global_active_power</b>: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt) </li>
<li><b>Global_reactive_power</b>: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt) </li>
<li><b>Voltage</b>: minute-averaged voltage (in volt) </li>
<li><b>Global_intensity</b>: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere) </li>
<li><b>Sub_metering_1</b>: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered). </li>
